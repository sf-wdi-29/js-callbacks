# Callbacks & Iterators

## Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Using callback functions is an effective way to write declarative, functional JavaScript. JavaScript was built to deal with asynchronous events; callbacks help appropriately time and coordinate our program.

## What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Pass a function as a callback to another function
- Use callbacks to build more declarative iterators
- Pick the best iterator for the job
- Build certain iterators from scratch


## Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Write and call functions in JavaScript
- Explain what a first-class or higher-order function is
- Use a `for` loop

## A Callback

Let's walk through a couple of examples of code that utilize callbacks:

```javascript
var element = document.querySelector("body");
var counter = 0;
element.addEventListener("click", function(){
  counter += 1;
  console.log("clicked " + counter + " times.");
})
```
*Discuss the above example with your neighbor.*

## An Iterator

```javascript
var potatoes = ["Yukon Gold", "Russet", "Yellow Finn", "Kestrel"];
for(var i=0; i < potatoes.length; i++){
    console.log(potatoes[i] + "!")
}
```

*Discuss the above example with your neighbor.*

## [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/ForEach)

Let's combine our knowledge of **callbacks** & **iterators** to write better, more *declarative* code.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry",
"Fig", "Guava", "Huckleberry", "Ice plant", "Jackfruit"];

fruits.forEach(function (value, index) {
    console.log(index + ". " + value);
});

// 0. Apple
// 1. Banana
// 2. Cherry
// 3. Durian
// 4. Elderberry
// 5. Fig
// 6. Guava
// 7. Huckleberry
// 8. Ice plant
// 9. Jackfruit
//=> ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry",
//    "Fig", "Guava", "Huckleberry", "Ice plant", "Jackfruit"];
```

## [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Map)
Similar to `forEach()`, `map()` traverses an array; this method, however, performs whatever callback function you pass into it on each element.  It outputs the results
of the operation on each element as a new array.

Often we want to do more than just perform an action, like console.log(), on every loop.  When we actually want to modify/manipulate our array, map is our best friend!

#### Example: Double every number

```javascript
var numbers = [1, 4, 9];
var doubles = numbers.map(function doubler(num) {
  return num * 2;
});
// doubles is now [2, 8, 18]. numbers is still [1, 4, 9]
```

#### Example: Pluralize all the fruit names

```javascript
pluralized_fruits = fruits.map(function pluralize(element) {

  // if word ends in 'y', remove 'y' and add 'ies' to the end
    var lastLetter = element[element.length -1];
     if (lastLetter === 'y') {
      element = element.slice(0,element.length-1) + 'ie';
  }

    return element + 's';
});

fruits // ORIGINAL ARRAY IS UNCHANGED!
//=> ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry",
//    "Fig", "Guava", "Huckleberry", "Ice plant", "Jackfruit"];

pluralized_fruits // MAP OUTPUT
//=> [ "Apples", "Bananas", "Cherries", "Durians", "Elderberries",
//    "Figs", "Guavas", "Huckleberries", "Ice plants", "Jackfruits"  ]
```

#### Example: Square each number

```javascript
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

numbers.map(function square(element) {
  return Math.pow(element, 2);
});
//=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

#### Challenge: Etsy Merchant

<details>
<summary>
Elaine the Etsy Merchant thinks her prices are scaring off customers. Subtracting one penny from every price might help!

```javascript
var prices = [3.00, 4.00, 10.00, 2.25, 3.01];
// create a new array with the reduced prices...
```
</summary>

```javascript
var prices = [3.00,4.00,10.00,2.25,3.01];
var reducedPrices = prices.map(function(price) {
  return price - 0.01;
});
```

</details>


### [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter)
With the `filter()` method you can create a *second* array filled with elements that pass certain criteria that you designate.  This is great for creating a sub array of fruits that start with vowels, a list of even numbers from a bigger list, and so on.  
  *It's important to remember that a filter method on an array requires a `boolean` return value for the callback function you pass as an argument.*

#### Example: Return a list of fruits that start with vowels

```javascript
var vowels = ["A", "E", "I", "O", "U"];
function vowelFruit(fruit) {
  var result = vowels.indexOf(fruit[0]) >= 0; // indexOf returns -1 if not found
  console.log("result for " + fruit + " is " + result);
  return result;
}
var vowelFruits = fruits.filter(vowelFruit);
//=> ["Apple", "Elderberry", "Ice plant"]
```

Or alternatively:

```javascript
var vowels = ["A", "E", "I", "O", "U"];

var vowelFruits = fruits.filter(function vowelFruit(fruit) {
  return vowels.indexOf(fruit[0]) >= 0; // indexOf returns -1 if not found
});
//=> ["Apple", "Elderberry", "Ice plant"]

```

#### Example: Find all the even numbers that are greater than 5 

```javascript
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

even = numbers.filter(function filterEvens(num) {
  var isEven = num%2==0;
  var greaterThanFive = num > 5;
  return isEven && greaterThanFive;
});
//=> [6, 8, 10]
```

#### Challenge: Birthdays

<details>
<summary>
Is there an interesting trend in birthdays?  Do people tend to be born more on even-numbered dates or odd-numbered dates? If so, what's the ratio? In class, let's take a quick poll of the days of the month people were born on. This is a great chance to do some serious science!

```javascript
var exampleBdays = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 10, 10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 15, 17, 17, 18, 20, 20, 26, 31];
// gather an array of all the even birthdays...
```
</summary>

```javascript
var exampleBdays = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 10, 10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 15, 17, 17, 18, 20, 20, 26, 31];
var birthDateEvens = exampleBdays.filter(function(birthday) {
  return birthday % 2 === 0 ? birthday : false;
});
```
</details>

## [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
The `reduce()` method is designed to create one single object that is the result of an action performed among all elements in an array.  It essentially 'reduces' the values of an array into one single value.

#### Example: Find the sum of all of the numbers in an array

```javascript
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

var sum = numbers.reduce(function add(previous, current) {
  return current + previous;
});

//=> 55

```

> In the above examples, notice how the first time the callback is called it receives `element[0]` and `element[1]`.
 
There is another way to call this function and specify an initial starting point. 

```javascript
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

var sum = numbers.reduce(function add(previous, current) {
  return current + previous;
}, 100);

//=> 155
```

In the above example, the first time the callback is called it receives `100` and `1`.

> **Note**: We set the starting value to `100` by passing in an optional second argument to reduce. 

#### Challenge: Dog Walking

<details>
<summary>
Boberto has a lucrative dog walking business. He's made that money this summer. How much did he make?

```javascript
var earnings = [20, 25, 60, 20, 85, 20];
// find the total of his earnings...
```
</summary>

```javascript
var earnings = [20, 25, 60, 20, 85, 20];
var total = earnings.reduce(function(previous, current) {
  return previous + current;
});
```
</details>


`Array.reduce()` isn't just good for combining numeric values. It also works when you want to flatten a matrix (an Array of Arrays). Perhaps the most useful implementation is if you have an array of objects and you want to gather all the values of one property, you can chain `Array.map()` and then `Array.reduce()` together. [Here's a good article with several clear examples for your consideration.](http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/boiling-down-arrays-with-array-reduce.html)

# Building Iterators Lab

#### How does `forEach` work?
Let's think about `forEach` again. What's happening behind the scenes?

* What are our inputs?
* What is our output?
* What happens on each loop?
* What does the callback function do?
* What gets passed into our callback function? i.e. what arguments?
  * Where does it come from?
  * How do we know what to name it?

Let's check:

```javascript
function print(item) {
  console.log(item);
}

[0, 100, 200, 300].forEach(function(number) {
  print(number);
});
```

<details>
<summary>Given the above, how would you build a function that mimics `forEach` yourself? Call it `myForEach`.</summary>

```javascript
function myForEach(collection, callback) {
  for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
    callback(collection[i]);
  }
}
// the below should have the same result as the above
myForEach([0, 100, 200, 300], print)
```
</details>


## Exercise: Build your own iterators

We are going to [**implement our own iterators**](https://github.com/sf-wdi-gaia/js-building-iterators-lab), from scratch.
